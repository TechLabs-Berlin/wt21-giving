The mission of the Israel Guide Dog Center for the Blind is to improve the quality of life of blind people by providing them with safe mobility, independence and self-confidence through the faithful assistance of guide dogs. Israel has over 24,000 registered blind people, although unofficial estimates place this figure much higher. Of these, about 250 are guide dog assisted, but this number is growing steadily as the number of graduates from the Center increases annually.","77":"Founded in 1989, the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) is dedicated to the survival of the world's rhino species through conservation and research. For 26 years, IRF has funded and operated rhino conservation programs in Africa and Asia, focusing expertise and resources in areas where rhinos are most in need of protection, and where conservation efforts will do the most good. At the heart of IRF's vision is the belief that these magnificent species should endure for future generations, and that protecting rhinos ensures the survival of many other species, including people. Since its founding, IRF has also provided funding for scientific research that enhances the ability to manage rhinoceros populations both in the wild. IRF has awarded nearly $700,000 to applied rhino research in the past 10 years, and is the only source of funding exclusively devoted to rhinoceros.","82":"The International Primate Protection League (IPPL) was founded in 1973, and, since this time, has been working continuously for the well-being of primates.

IPPL has raised funds to help other sanctuaries working to provide a safe and enriching environment for primate victims of deforestation and poaching.","106":"The International Crane Foundation (ICF), founded in 1973, works worldwide to conserve cranes and the wetland and grassland ecosystems on which they depend.
